We can all acknowledge that AI can be a buzz word and does not need to be applied in a majority of situations.  Few people will be justified in their pursuit of AI Applications. Consultants will be among those people and they will be justified to talk about it because AI indeed represents a big business opportunity. Different consulting companies have different estimates but companies like Deloitte, McKinsey, PwC all rightly claim that AI is a multi trillion dollar economic opportunity for the world which will be unlocked in the next decade.

When we talk about AI being a multi trillion dollar economic opportunity it is important to note who that opportunity will be coming to.  AI will be a solution to many problems that are repetative to large scale companies.  These large companies such as banks, management firms, supply chain, and others know that this is a problem and are eager to peice together a solution.  In a report by BCG and MIT SMR it is summarized that the following 3 factors are what lead to slow adoption of AI solutions in large companies.
- Lack of an AI strategy
- Lach of awareness of AI capabilities
- Lack of internal AI talent in the organization

## AI Consulting is becoming important
Take note that I claimed that it is BECOMING important.  Currently, there is demand for artificial intelligence related products, but supply side is limited. Either the technology isn’t mature yet or the Companies don’t know which firm to hire. 

The technology not being mature along with there not being a leading firm in this department combine to show why the demand is not at the maximum yet. 

As the technology matures and firms build competing COEs or CCs, AI consulting will be a highly important industry in the near future.  Whether that be through mergers and aquisitions by the larger firms or through success on their own.

In a recent report by Capgemini Consulting an interesting problem is presented.  They claim that 54% of firms miss the chance to implement low complexity and high benefit AI/ML use cases.  Meaning, when working with a client and you implement an AI solution, as a consulting organization you tend to use third-party solutions rather than your own products.  

This is important to note.  This goes directly against everything we know about an effective business.  By building these third party tools as a much larger organization we could quickly eclipse the capabilities of the smaller third-party, use this new tool to sell more work, and even put this towards building out AI CC or COE.

## Establishing AI COEs
As stated in a HBR article: "The idea of establishing a CC or COE in AI is not particularly radical. In one recent survey of U.S. executives from large firms using AI, 37% said they had already established such an organization."

Others are doing this.  Primarily global and very large companies are working hard and dedicating large amounts of resources towards organizing AI talent.  When asked, the main reason for doing so is not quite what you would expect.

MBB is predicting that large tech companies will begin offering AI consulting services in the next decade for other companies that need these solutions.  We will see Apple, Google, and Amazon increasingly offering more AI solutions consulting as they build tools that only they have access to.

By prioritizing your AI COE as a consulting firm you will be among the first to attract top AI talent that will allow you to compete in the years to come.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, why should conculting companies be prepping their AI COEs in 2022?

They should for multipule reasons but they all come back to competing.  Consulting firms have been innovating for a long time, this is no different.  

In the short term: Consultancies that have appropriate resources should build AI teams and tools to allow them to sell more high-priced work, have more assets to attract work, and claim more credit for solutions rather than sharing with third parties.  

In the long term: Consultancies need to have AI COEs in order to compete with the introduction of large tech companies offering consulting services.  By starting early and building teams that can adapt fast, they will be able to remain competitive with the perceived powerhouses of technology.
