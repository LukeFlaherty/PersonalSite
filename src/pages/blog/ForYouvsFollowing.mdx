import BlogPost from '../../components/BlogPost'

export const meta = {
	title: 'For You page or Following Page? What do consumers want?',
	date: new Date('2023-07-08'),
	description:
		"We get it, automation is a hot topic. After all if it was not you would not be reading this article.",
}
<!-- change description -->

export default ({ children }) => (
	<BlogPost meta={meta}>{children}</BlogPost>

)

So, what app is your favorite to consumer content on?

I personally use a lot of TikTok and Twitter. I also watch a lot of Youtube.

Why does it matter?

Well, it matters in the context of this blog post becasue we are examining the ways users choose to consume content and some of the drawbacks to it.

This is an issue that Frontend UI & UX teams are primarily interested in.

Consider this workflow, I browse content on a "ForYou" type of recommendation page and engage with a video or post. I then say to myself "I would like to see more of this person/subject". So I follow them.

Do you know what happens next behind the screen?
