So, what app is your favorite to consumer content on?

I personally use a lot of TikTok and Twitter. I also watch a lot of Youtube.

Why does it matter?

Well, it matters in the context of this blog post becasue we are examining the ways users choose to consume content and some of the drawbacks to it.

This is an issue that Frontend UI & UX teams are primarily interested in.

Consider this workflow, I browse content on a "ForYou" type of recommendation page and engage with a video or post. I then say to myself "I would like to see more of this person/subject". So I follow them.

Do you know what happens next behind the screen?

The algorithm will then show me miore of this content but ONLY in the "Following" page. And will actually typically negatively affect the recommendation rate in the "For You" page.

Do you see the problem here?

Many users will engage like this and then will be frustrated they dont see more content. But the content is there but only in the "Following" page. This begs the question: Do you trust your algorithm enough to get rid of the Following page? Sure it may work properly but what is users want to "collect" content creators.
