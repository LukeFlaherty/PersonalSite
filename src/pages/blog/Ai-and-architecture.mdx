We get it, automation is a hot topic. After all if it was not you would not be reading this article. Nearly everybody has a necessity for automation, whether we are going the route of full blown automation or having people do majority of the work and finish it off with high intelligence computers. All of us are getting more comfortable with artificial intelligence playing a role in evolving enterprises, medicine, automobiles, and manufacturing. Architecture is no different.

The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in innovative businesses is not without its own obstacles. The obstacles are often shaped as concerns such GAN Exploitation or Designers being worried about AI not understanding the creative process. Given that the main purpose of AI is to make machines more suited to projects that require self-direction and independent learning, these concerns are both logical. However, most experts concur that AI can possibly make architecture simpler, more efficient, more productive, and even safer.

Computers tend to excel at curating answers to well-defined issues very quickly, saving people time to be innovative and work at more open-ended problems which are very abundant in the field of architecture. Computers wishing to colonize the field of architecture design will be met with appropriate discontent. However, even as AI advanced across other design related industries, AI continuously demonstrates its ability accomplish overall good for its users.
Improved Structure Planning Efficiency

Architects normally use data manually to pull things such as temperature data, climate information, material appraisals, and more when pondering a design. Although this is not necessarily AI, this is a low-risk place for technology to step in and lend a hand as an unpaid intern. Software tools and programs are able to make building computations and environmental analysis a simple task for architects. I am sure as a human with consciousness you are realizing how this data can be used to provide recommendations of the most efficient way to go about a project. Using climate data to recommend building structure, cross referenced with the material appraisals recommending the most cost effective material to build with.

Envision you have to design a family’s new home, you must consider the client’s needs and expectations as well as consider the laws that oversee what you are allowed to construct. 

For an architect, beginning this task requires innumerable periods of research which could take months. AI would be glad to help with this.

With its ability to take in boundless amounts of information, an architect could, in theory, utilize AI to explore a multitude of different ideas simultaneously and arrive at their pros and cons with much more ease. Meaning conceptual design would be done with practically no utilization of the pen and paper AND with twice the turnaround speed. This leads us beautifully into our next topic.
Parametric Architecture

Parametric Architecture is a trendy expression that you have likely come across while diving into the universe of modern architecture.

Parametric design is a framework that permits you to adjust specific parameters to make various structures and forms that would not have been possible otherwise, thus, “Elevating Design through Architecture”. Practically its own AI assisted Architect programming language, this tool enables the architect to pick their design yield, set the imperatives of the build, utilize the latest information, and make endless iterations of their product within minutes.
More Secure Buildings

Often organizations from workplaces to college campuses have utilized a video security system to protect the premises. Ergonomic design was not expected to stem from surveillance technology, however let me point it out to you.

A smart security system integrated into a building can rapidly examine the video feeds of the premises, identifying suspicious activity and spotting activity in different rooms. Artificial Intelligence can be used to detect when people are using different parts of the building, thus adjusting the resource consumption of those unused parts of the building. 

Ergonomics have been shown to reduce costs of maintaining super structures like skyscrapers as the light bills on these structures are mega! With Artificial Intelligence never letting you forget to turn off the lights and shutting off resource consumption in unused parts of buildings this will lead to the designers being able to take on extra scope elsewhere and many other benefits.
Smart Cities

Finally we can talk about the future. Change is something that you should forget to account for. The manner in which your city looks today will be totally different in the coming years. The most challenging task for an architect is city planning that needs a ton of precision planning. In any case, the essential task is to examine all the potential perspectives of how the city will scale and how the population will be in the coming years.

Now that you know AI is creeping itself into the world of architecture construction and design, imagine for yourself how it can help us plan smart cities for the future. 

Will AI suggest cities be more walk-able to reduce carbon emissions?
Will AI suggest more stories to adjust for a growing population?
Will AI suggest that we live at the office to remain productive?

As I conclude my first article on LinkedIn, I wanted to say thank you for reading, I am sure I will improve and progress, and thank you for sticking around to the end!

How do you think AI will continue to shape Architecture?

P.S. This was not written by an Architecture student, rather a Computer Science student who studies AI and has always been fascinated with architecture and design :)
