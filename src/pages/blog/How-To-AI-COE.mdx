Artificial intelligence is transforming life as we know it. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated automation and increased enterprise investment in AI across the globe. The global AI market size is expected to grow to USD 309.6 billion by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 39.7%. While there is greater adoption of AI worldwide, scaling AI projects is not easy.

According to Gartner, the staff skills, the fear of the unknown, and finding a clear starting point for AI projects are some of the most prominent challenges faced by enterprises in their AI journey. To overcome these challenges and launch new AI initiatives, executives are setting up dedicated AI knowledge platforms or AI Center of Excellence (AI CoE) within their organization. As per a Harvard Business Review article, 37% of U.S. executives from large firms that use AI have already established a COE in AI.

## What is an AI COE?
It's pretty simple actually, it is just a centralized knowledge group or team that guides and oversees the implementation of organization-wide AI projects.  An AI CoE brings together the AI talent, knowledge, and resources required to enable AI-based transformation projects. It brings together all the AI capabilities needed to address the challenges of AI adoption and prioritize AI investments.

They are essentially an internal centralized counsel to identify new opportunities for leveraging AI to solve various business problems such as controlling costs, improve efficiency, and optimize revenue.

Furthermore, the key objective of this "AI Counsel" would be to build and support the AI vision of the company and serve as an internal counsel to manage all AI projects.

## Why do you need an AI COE?
There are many different companies and they may all benefit from having one but for now we will focus on consulting firms.

An AI CoE plays a vital role in developing AI talent and driving innovation within the company.  By providing a robust framework for AI implementation, the CoE helps in building future-ready engineering capabilities to manage high volumes of data, improve efficiency, and drive innovation. 

Here are the key benefits summed up in bullet points in case you are in a hurry:

- To consolidate AI resources, learnings, and talent in one place.
- To create and implement a unified AI vision and strategy for the business.
- To standardize the platforms, processes, and approach to AI within the organization.
- To speed up AI-led innovation and identify new revenue opportunities.
- To scale data science efforts and make AI accessible to every function within the company.
- To drive AI-enabled initiatives such as cost reduction, churn prevention, and revenue maximization to stay ahead of competitors.

## Building an AI COE
So, how do we actually build it.  Well you could buy it.  You can get on a good start through the M&A route, this will be incomplete though and you will spend far more money.  The only benefit of doing this would be the large amount of press you would get for acquiring a name-brand ML company.  This would also attract other talent to your otganization.

So you dont want to go the M&A route.  You are now faced with the harsh reality that technology is constantly evolving. Enterprises must continuously adapt their AI roadmap to deliver the highest business value. With scattered data science teams, resources, and legacy systems, it becomes hard to know where to start. To set up an AI innovation center, business leaders must take a holistic approach.

Let us break it down into 4 steps or pillars:

**Strategy**: Strategy is helpful for defining the business goals, identifying the most high-impact use cases for your company, and prioritizing where the money will go.  You should avoid thinking big while strategizing, instead it is wise to remain focused on small, achievable, realistic AI goals.  These goals would ask "How long will it take us to build this" and not "How are we going to technically achieve this".  This allows you to progress quickly and see ROI fast.

**People**: People help define the data-driven culture and the strategies for managing the teams building the AI. First, it is very important to clearly define the roles and structure for driving AI projects.  Second, the "who" you hire is just as important as how many you hire.  We have seen with examples like Tesla who quickly rose to the forefront of AI talent and their recruiting techniques.  Tesla attracts the best of the best talent by having a great brand image in terms of AI.  This is worth putting some money into as you will never accomplish this the traditional way.  You will use specialized technical recruiting companies such as [Lazr Recruiting](https://www.lazrrecruiting.com/) to attract the top talent by having a good recruiting brand image.

**Processes** The process-oriented pillar helps to define the methods to sustain continual AI innovation.  Anyone familliar with the terrain knows AI is a field that can have extreme updates happening in the blink of an eye.  The more iterative and agile the process is, the easier it is to stay up-to-date with the most efficient versions of AI processes.  For example, you may be using an algorithm to determine personalized product recommendations and over the weekend a better algorithm is discovered.  These updates are free for anyone who knows how to implement them to use, so if the process is agile enough, you are only a few tests and one production push away from having the top-of-the-line processes.

**Technology** The right technology stack is crucial for building robost AI capabilities.  This is similliar to the process pillar because the tech stack should be iterative and agile.  It is noteable individually becasue you may need to upgrade internal infrastructure to allow for AI/ML capabilities.

If executed with leadership commitment and a very well-planned strategy, AI has the power to reward organizations with incredible rewards. However, if not operated with the right fundamentals and critical mass scale, it could become a bottomless pit of investments with no significant returns.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we have defined what a AI COE is as well as discussed the pillars that hold up a successful AI COE.  

Let me leave you with some solid tips or processes to get you thinking:

1. Set AI vision and measurable goals 
2. Assemble the right team and set up governance
3. Get your data ready for AI 
4. Standardize and create reusable AI assets
